# data-driven_diabetic_diagnosis

The projects aims to analyse data from the Pima Indians Diabetes Database to be able to predict whether a patient has diabetes or not. The project uses machine learning techniques to build predictive models based on various health metrics such as age, BMI, blood pressure, and glucose levels.
The streamlit interface provides an interactive way to explore and visualize the data, train supervised and unsupervised Machine Learning algorithms and evaluate their performande and make predictions based on user input.

### Features
- Data exploration and visualization
- Machine learning model training and evaluation
- Interactive user interface with Streamlit

### Installation
To run the project, follow these steps:

1- create a python virtual environment and activate it
2- install the dependencies via requirements.txt
3- run the streamlit app via streamlit run app/app.py
